## Custom TCP protocol

### üìù Project description
This project was created as a **semestral task** for a networking subject at our uni. I was asked to develop custom TCP-like protocol inserted into the UDP protocol. This required proper understanding of both **UDP and TCP protocols**. I chose Python for this project because it felt the most straightforward to work with. 
At first, I had no idea how the project would function‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt even imagine the *‚Äúmagic‚Äù* of **transferring data** from my laptop to a friend‚Äôs. However, **signs of success** appeared quickly. Within just a few days, I had implemented the **basic functionality**, and from there I focused on fine-tuning the code to **improve stability** and **speed**.
After many hours of **testing** and **refining**, I was finally satisfied with the **core system**. I then had some fun experimenting with **CLI animations** - adding things like a **loading bar** while sending or receiving files, or notifications for peer disconnections.
Following several more weeks of polishing and testing, I **successfully built a system** capable of sending and receiving **text messages**, any type of **file**, and **system messages** - all with maximum stability and reliability.
